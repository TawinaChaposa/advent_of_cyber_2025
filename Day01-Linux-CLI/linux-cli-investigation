# Day 01 – Linux CLI

## Objective
Day ones objective was to Learn the basics of the Linux command-line interface (CLI) and use it to navigate the file system and investigate a security scenario.

## Key Concepts
- The CLI allows interaction with the system using commands.
- Many security and IT tasks rely on the CLI rather than a GUI.
- Hidden files start with a dot (`.`) and may contain important data.

## Steps Taken

### Exploring the Home Directory
- `ls` – List visible files and directories
- `ls -la` – List all files including hidden ones
- `cd Guides` – Move into the Guides directory
- `cat .guide.txt` – Read the hidden security guide

### Investigating Logs
- `cd /var/log` – Navigate to system logs
- `grep "Failed password" auth.log` – Search for failed login attempts

### Finding Suspicious Files
- `find /home/socmas -name *egg*` – the key was the keyword "find" which is a command that searches for files with specific parameters

### Analyzing Scripts
- `cat eggstrike.sh` – Examine the malicious script
- Observed usage of pipes (`|`), output redirection (`>`), and conditional execution (`&&`)
[**Pipe (`|`)**  Sends the output of one command as input to another.  
  *Example:* `cat unordered-list.txt | sort | uniq`
- **Output Redirection (`>` / `>>`)**  
  - `>` overwrites the contents of a file  
  - `>>` appends output to the end of a file  
  *Example:* `some-long-command > /home/mcskidy/output.txt`

- **Double Ampersand (`&&`)** Executes the second command only if the first command succeeds.  
  *Example:* `grep "secret" message.txt && echo "Secret found!"`]

### User Permissions
- `whoami` – to Check current user
- `sudo su` – to Switch to root for elevated privileges
- `cat /etc/shadow` – (Requires root) Access user password hashes
- `history` – Review command history for traces of malicious activity

## Key Learnings
- Hidden files and log files are valuable sources of information.
- Pipes, redirection, and scripting allow automation and manipulation of data.
- Root access is powerful but requires careful handling.
- Bash history can reveal evidence of past system activity.
