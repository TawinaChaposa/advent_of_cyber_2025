#Day 1: Linux CLI Investigation – Uncovering the First Clues
##Scenario Overview

The unthinkable has happened — McSkidy has been kidnapped. Without her leadership, Wareville’s cyber defenses are weakening, and Christmas itself is under threat.

As a cybersecurity analyst supporting The Best Festival Company (TBFC), my first task was to investigate tbfc-web01, a Linux server responsible for processing Christmas wishlists. McSkidy’s final actions may hold critical clues about who attacked the system and what their intentions were.

With no graphical interface available, the investigation had to be carried out entirely using the Linux Command-Line Interface (CLI) — just as it would be in a real-world security incident.

##Investigation Approach

The investigation followed a logical incident-response flow:

- Explore the system using Linux CLI commands

- Identify hidden files and suspicious artifacts

Inspect logs for signs of brute-force activity

- Locate and analyze malicious scripts

- Check command history for attacker traces

##Initial System Reconnaissance

I began by exploring McSkidy’s home directory and reviewing files she left behind. A message in README.txt hinted that:

- The system had been attacked

- A security guide had been hidden intentionally

- Logs would be crucial to the investigation

This immediately directed the investigation toward hidden files and system logs.

##Hidden Files & Directory Analysis

Upon navigating to the Guides directory, no files appeared at first glance. However, using advanced listing options revealed a hidden security guide, confirming McSkidy had intentionally concealed it from attackers.

The guide pointed to /var/log/ and specifically encouraged filtering logs rather than manually reading them — a realistic SOC analyst technique.

##Log Analysis (Authentication Logs)

By inspecting authentication logs, I discovered multiple failed login attempts targeting the socmas account, all originating from HopSec infrastructure. This indicated an active brute-force or credential-stuffing attempt.

This confirmed that the attackers were already interacting with the system before McSkidy disappeared.

##Malware Discovery & Analysis

Using file discovery techniques, I identified a suspicious shell script named eggstrike.sh in the socmas user directory.

Upon reviewing its contents, the script was clearly malicious:

- It extracted and exfiltrated wishlist data

- Deleted legitimate Christmas wishlists

- Replaced them with EASTMAS-themed content

This demonstrated direct manipulation of business-critical data, aligning with King Malhare’s campaign.

##Privilege Escalation & Attacker Traces

To deepen the investigation, I escalated privileges to the root user and inspected Bash history files. The attacker’s command history revealed outbound curl requests, confirming data exfiltration to HopSec-controlled servers.

This was the strongest evidence that the system had been actively compromised.

##Useful Commands Used in This Challenge



##Skills & Concepts Learned

- Linux command-line navigation
- Hidden file discovery
- Log analysis using grep
- Malware script inspection
- Privilege escalation awareness
- Bash history forensics
- Realistic Linux incident investigation

##Key Takeaway
This challenge demonstrated that Linux CLI proficiency is essential in cybersecurity.
Without any graphical tools, it was still possible to:

Identify attacker activity

Trace malicious scripts

Confirm data exfiltration

Reconstruct the attack timeline
