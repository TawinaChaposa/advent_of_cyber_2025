#Advent of Cyber 2025 - Overview

Advent of Cyber 2025 was a 24-day hands-on cybersecurity challenge that ran from 1st to 24th December 2025.
Each day introduced a new practical challenge designed to simulate real-world cyber security scenarios, covering both offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) perspectives.

The challenge focused on building practical skills, strengthening incident investigation ability, and improving understanding of how modern cyber attacks work — and how defenders detect and respond to them.

This repository documents my learning journey, including notes, tools used, techniques learned, and key takeaways from each challenge.

##Objectives of Advent of Cyber
- Build a strong foundation in cybersecurity concepts
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world attack and defense techniques
- Improve investigation, analysis, and problem-solving skills
- Learn how tools are used in Security Operations Centers (SOCs)
- Develop good documentation and reporting habits

##Key Topics Covered

During the 24 days, the challenge covered the following areas:

- Linux Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Exploitation using cURL
- Web Attack Forensics
- Phishing Detection & Analysis
- Malware Analysis
- Password Cracking Techniques
- Network Discovery & Enumeration
- SOC Alert Triage
