##Day 04 – AI-Assisted Cyber Security Operations

###Scenario Overview

TBFC introduced a new AI-powered cyber security assistant, Van SolveIT, to help improve productivity and security operations. As Christmas approached, the organization wanted to test whether AI could effectively assist with offensive security, defensive investigations, and secure software analysis before deploying it into real workflows.

###My Role

I acted as a Cyber Security Analyst evaluating the effectiveness of an AI assistant across red team, blue team, and secure software development scenarios. My responsibility was to validate AI-generated outputs, execute recommended actions safely, and assess the risks and limitations of AI in cyber security workflows.

###Tools Used

- Van SolveIT (AI Cyber Security Assistant)
- Web application testing environment
- Python exploit execution
- Web log analysis
- Source code review

###Investigation / Evaluation Approach

I interacted with the AI assistant across three security domains. First, I used AI-generated exploit code in a controlled environment to validate offensive recommendations. Next, I analyzed web logs of a simulated attack using AI-assisted summarization to identify malicious patterns. Finally, I reviewed vulnerable source code with AI guidance to identify common security flaws.

Throughout the exercise, I critically evaluated AI outputs, validating recommendations rather than blindly trusting them.

###Key Findings

- AI successfully generated a working SQL injection exploit when provided with sufficient context.
- AI-assisted log analysis helped quickly identify attack indicators in large datasets.
- AI was effective at identifying insecure coding patterns but required human validation.
- Overreliance on AI without verification could introduce operational and ethical risks.

###Outcome

The exercise demonstrated that AI can significantly accelerate cyber security tasks when used as an assistant, not a replacement. Human oversight remained essential to prevent false positives, unsafe exploitation, and misinterpretation of results.

###Useful Commands / Actions


###Skills & Concepts Learned

- Practical use of AI in red and blue team workflows
- Risks and limitations of AI-generated security output
